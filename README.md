For every transaction that you relay you will receive a reward in the form of EOS tokens.

## Logging

This project uses [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging.

When you run the miner a directory called `logs` will be created in the root of the project. 
Inside you will find two log files, `combined.log` and `error.log`.
